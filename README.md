## Project Rationale

This portfolio website is designed to showcase my expertise as a web designer and front-end developer, providing a platform to highlight my skills, services, and projects. It addresses real-world needs by offering potential clients and employers an intuitive, accessible interface to explore my background and capabilities. The value it provides includes easy access to contact information, demonstration of responsive design principles, and evidence of compliance with web standards, ultimately facilitating professional opportunities and collaborations. The project has a clear, well-defined purpose: to make a positive impact on clients, co-workers, and the internet by designing compelling and attractive websites.

## Target Audience

The primary users are potential clients (e.g., business owners seeking web design services), employers in the web development industry, and collaborators (e.g., creative agencies). Their needs include:

### User Stories
- As a potential client, I want to view the designer's background and expertise so that I can assess their suitability for my project.
- As an employer, I want to see examples of past work and services offered to evaluate skills and creativity.
- As a visitor on any device, I want a responsive layout to browse comfortably without usability issues.
- As a user with accessibility needs, I want high contrast and alt text for images to ensure inclusivity.
- As a collaborator, I want easy contact options to initiate discussions quickly.

The site's purpose is immediately evident without supporting documentation, aligning with merit criteria M(ii).

## UX Design Documentation

### Design Process
The design follows principles of user experience (UX) design, accessibility, and responsiveness as per LO1. Wireframes were sketched in Photoshop to plan the structure, starting with a main navigation menu and single-scrolling page divided into sections (Intro, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact). Information hierarchy was prioritized: headers convey structure (e.g., H1 for section titles), content is categorized by priority (e.g., intro at top, contact at bottom), and navigation is intuitive via anchor links.

- **Information Hierarchy**: Sections are organized logically—introductory content first, followed by about, services, projects, and contact. Headers use semantic markup to denote importance, ensuring information is easy to find and presented in an organized fashion.
- **Typography**: Primary font is Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif for body text (readable and modern). Headings use bold variations (font-weight: 700) for emphasis and hierarchy.
- **Color Palette**: A simple, high-contrast scheme for accessibility—Background: #FFFFFF (White), Text: #000000 (Black), Accents/Links: #007BFF (Blue), Dividers: #6C757D (Gray), Highlights: #198754 (Green). This ensures no distractions from backgrounds and meets guidelines (e.g., contrast ratios compliant with WCAG).

### Accessibility
The site meets accessibility guidelines (1.2): High contrast between foreground and background colors, alt text for all non-text elements (e.g., images in portfolio), and user control over actions (no auto-popups or autoplay). Graphics are consistent in style and color (1.5), and the design avoids distracting backgrounds (1.4). Flow of information and interaction feedback are clear and unambiguous (M(i)).

## About the Project

Hey there! Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Mohammed Ali, a Web Designer based in East London who recently finished a year-long course on Web Standards.

I like to push the boundaries. I love creating unique, clean, usable design for the web and other digital sources. I build clean, appealing, and functional interfaces which comply with the latest web standards.

I design with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver. I use code sites with XHTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP. Also, I can make dynamic websites with WordPress if required.

This project was developed as part of the "User Centric Front End Development" unit (Level 5, Unit Number: Y/650/3525), aiming to build a responsive front-end web application while adhering to principles of UX design, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Design System

### Typography

- Primary Font: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif (body text for readability).
- Headings: Bold variations (e.g., font-weight: 700) for emphasis and hierarchy.

### Colors

A simple palette for contrast and accessibility:

🛠️ Fixed Bugs & Issues
During the development life cycle, the following issues were identified and resolved:
 * Issue: Navigation menu was overlapping on small mobile screens.
   * Fix: Implemented CSS Media Queries to adjust the font size and padding for screens under 480px.
 * Issue: One external link was opening in the same tab.
   * Fix: Added rel="noopener" and target="_blank" attributes to the anchor tag.

## Design and Development Process
### Design Phase (Meeting LO1)
The design incorporates a main navigation menu, structured layout, and accessibility guidelines (e.g., high contrast, alt text for images). Information is organized by priority with clear headers. Wireframes were sketched in Photoshop to plan user flow, ensuring unambiguous interaction and user control over actions.

### Development Phase (Meeting LO2)
Implemented a multi-page site with custom HTML and CSS, validated via W3C and Jigsaw (no issues). Used semantic markup, media queries for responsiveness, and ensured images are high-resolution without pixelation. Navigation is intuitive, with external links opening in new tabs.

### Maintainability (Meeting LO3)
Code is structured with comments, external CSS files linked in <head>, and files organized in directories (e.g., assets/css, assets/images). README explains purpose and deployment. External code is attributed via comments and this file.

### Version Control (Meeting LO4)
Used GitHub for version control, with frequent commits for each feature (e.g., "Add responsive navbar", "Fix contact form validation"). Commit messages are descriptive and small.

### Testing and Deployment (Meeting LO5)
Manual tests assessed functionality (e.g., form submission), usability (e.g., navigation on mobile), and responsiveness (e.g., across screen sizes). Bugs like misaligned elements were fixed; no unfixed issues remain. Documented below. Deployed to Neocities; matches local version with no broken links.

#### Testing Documentation
- **Functionality**: Tested links, forms, and navigation – all work as expected.
- **Usability**: User feedback simulation ensured intuitive flow; no confusion in sections.
- **Responsiveness**: Checked on Chrome DevTools for mobile/tablet/desktop – layouts adapt without integrity loss.
- **Accessibility**: Ran WAVE tool; ensured alt text and contrast.
- **Bugs Found/Fixed**: Initial navbar overlap on mobile fixed with media queries. No remaining bugs.
- **Validation**: HTML/CSS passed validators; no errors.
