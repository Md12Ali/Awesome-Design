## About the Project

Hey there! Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Mohammed Ali, a Web Designer based in East London who recently finished a year-long course on Web Standards.

I like to push the boundaries. I love creating unique, clean, usable design for the web and other digital sources. I build clean, appealing, and functional interfaces which comply with the latest web standards.

I design with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver. I use code sites with XHTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP. Also, I can make dynamic websites with WordPress if required.

## Tech Stack

Built using modern web technologies for a responsive and engaging user experience.
